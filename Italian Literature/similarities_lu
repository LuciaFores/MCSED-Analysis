In Canto 23, Orlando loses his mind and begins to attack anyone in his way, including his own companions. Here is a quote from the poem: "Love and madness, hand in hand, have wrought / This strange confusion in Orlando's thought."

The Lord of the Rings: The theme of love and madness is also present in The Lord of the Rings, particularly in the character of Gollum.

He's been warped and ruined from long brooding on that one thing, a palantir of the Enemy."

2. The Power of Words:

In Book I, Chapter 2, Frodo expresses his fear of the Ring's power: "I do not wish to give it up...and yet I know that if I do not, the Quest cannot go on." Similarly, in Book II, Chapter 10, Boromir is tempted by the Ring's power and tries to take it from Frodo: "Give the Ring to me, Frodo...It is a gift, I say; a gift to the foes of Mordor." Both Orlando Furioso and The Lord of the Rings explore the dangers of the lure of power and the ways in which it can corrupt even the most noble of characters.

4. The Power of Music:

In Book IV, Chapter 4, Sam reflects on the importance of their friendship: "I can't carry it for you...but I can carry you and it as well. So up you get! Come on, Mr. Frodo dear! Sam will give you a ride. Just tell him where to go, and he'll go." Both Orlando Furioso andThe Lord of the Rings explore the power of friendship and the ways in which it can provide strength and support during difficult times.














Certainly! Here are some specific passages from Orlando Furioso and A Song of Ice and Fire that relate to the following themes:

1. Love and Madness:

The character of Orlando is a prime example of this theme, as he goes mad with love for Angelica and becomes a danger to himself and others. In Canto 23, Orlando loses his mind and begins to attack anyone in his way, including his own companions.

A Song of Ice and Fire: The theme of love and madness is also present in A Song of Ice and Fire, particularly in the character of King Aerys II Targaryen, also known as the "Mad King."
Yes, there is an example of a character in A Song of Ice and Fire who turns mad because the object of their love does not reciprocate their feelings. That character is King Aerys II Targaryen, also known as the Mad King.
Aerys was obsessed with Joanna Lannister, the wife of his Hand of the King, Tywin Lannister. Aerys had been infatuated with Joanna since they were children. When Joanna married Tywin instead of Aerys, Aerys became increasingly paranoid and unstable, and his obsession with Joanna grew more intense. He would make inappropriate comments about her in public, and rumors spread that he had made advances towards her, which she rebuffed.
As Aerys' mental state deteriorated, he became more and more tyrannical and cruel. He would hear whispers of treason in every corner and saw enemies everywhere. He became obsessed with fire, and would often order people to be burned alive.
In the end, Aerys' madness led to his downfall. He was eventually overthrown by rebels led by Robert Baratheon and Ned Stark, and Jaime Lannister, one of his own Kingsguard, killed him to prevent him from burning the city with wildfire.
So, Aerys' madness was driven in part by his unrequited love for Joanna Lannister, which fueled his paranoia and obsession.
